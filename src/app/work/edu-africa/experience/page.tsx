                    Those four weeks in South Africaâ€”three in Cape Town and one
                    exploring Durban and Saint Luciaâ€”fundamentally transformed
                    how I approach technology, community, and my role as a
                    global citizen. Working with Safe Cities taught me that
                    sustainable change comes from relationships, not just
                    solutions.

                    The platform was just the beginning. The real impact has
                    been the ongoing collaboration with South African
                    communities, the Ubuntu philosophy that now guides my work,
                    and the understanding that the best technology amplifies
                    human connection rather than replacing it.
